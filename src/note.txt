-API call in Javascript-
 ----------------------
 AJAX
 -- XMLhttp
 -- fetch
 -- asynch await

 useEffect is use as NgOninit()


 REDIRECTION IN REACT
 -------------------------
react-router-dom = is use in react for redirection
this module is not avaliable it has to be install 
----------->  npm i  react-router-dom


routing is do in app.js 
import { BrowserRouter as Router ->all routing need components
,Routes ->  to set paths for each components
,Route ->morethan one path
 } from 'react-router-dom';


useParams: hoook to access params from component url

REDUX
---

Couplling - ----- > many connection between parent and child component
props drilling -- > inn coupling if any intermediate component have any error all  the 
                    other childs will not work.

     To  avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and mske all the component indepedent
     for this react introduced a new technology  --react intriduced a state managemrnt technology
     called REDUX

redux process
------------
create a new js file to keep the state , all the component can access the js file.
the component only can access the data from the js file
 but they can't update the data in the js file
 
there are 4 pillars 

 Action - a file where all the logics to update the state

 Dispatch - method used to  dispatch the logic in action 
            file when the component need state updation.

 Reducer - update the data in js file according to the 
           payload response get action file

libaries to apply  redux 
------------------------
1. REDUX
2. REACT REDUX
3. REDUX-THUNK
npm i redux  react-redux redux-thunk

createStore() -- method in redux used to create store in js file 
               two argument 
               1. Reducer
               2. middleware (use to make synchronous redux into asynchronous)

   applyMiddleware() - method in redux to apply middleware            

   CombineReducers() - method in Redux used to combine all the reducers in js file

   thunk() --- use to create middleware

   1. create store 
   2, apply the store in index.js 
        provider its a tag used to pass the store{react-redux}
